# RealEstateTrajectory-Repo
 A calculator to calculate the trajectory annually for a real estate company
It calculates the Statistical analysis and does comparotive analysis for the given data as well
The analysis will be completed when a comparative analysis is done. This analysis will be done using several algorithms. The algorithms that will be used are Root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean-square-error (MSE). These algorithms are performance algorithms that will evaluate how well the simulation perform when compared to the actual data. 
The analysis that must be performed on each data are the min, max, mean, variance, and standard deviation
